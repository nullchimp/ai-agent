best_practices:
  - "Choose visualization based on the question you're trying to answer"
  - "Keep designs simple and focused on the data"
  - "Use appropriate color schemes (sequential, diverging, categorical)"
  - "Label axes clearly and include units"
  - "Add context with annotations when necessary"
  - "Be aware of how different scales can change perception of data"
  - "Test visualizations with target audience to ensure clarity"
  - "Consider accessibility aspects (color blindness, contrast)"

relationships_to_ml:
  - "Visualizations are critical for exploratory data analysis before modeling"
  - "Help identify patterns and relationships that can inform feature engineering"
  - "Useful for model evaluation (ROC curves, confusion matrices, residual plots)"
  - "Important for communicating model results to stakeholders"
  - "Reveals insights about model performance across different segments"
