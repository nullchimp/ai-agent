# Graph Databases for Knowledge Management

## Introduction to Graph Databases

Graph databases are specialized database systems designed to store and query data whose relationships are as important as the data itself. Unlike traditional relational databases that store data in tables with predefined relationships, graph databases represent data through nodes (entities) connected by edges (relationships).

## Core Concepts

### Nodes
Nodes represent entities such as people, products, or concepts. They can contain properties (key-value pairs) that describe the entity's attributes.

### Edges
Edges represent relationships between nodes. They can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way) and often have properties of their own.

### Properties
Both nodes and edges can have associated properties, which are key-value pairs that provide additional information.

### Labels
In many graph databases, nodes can have labels that indicate their type or role within the graph.

## Query Languages

### Cypher (Neo4j)
```cypher
// Find connections between machine learning concepts
MATCH (c1:Concept {name: "Machine Learning"})-[:RELATED_TO*1..2]->(c2:Concept)
RETURN c1.name AS Source, c2.name AS RelatedConcept
```

### GSQL (TigerGraph)
```gsql
CREATE QUERY findRelatedConcepts(STRING conceptName) FOR GRAPH KnowledgeGraph {
  TYPEDEF TUPLE<STRING source, STRING related> Relationship;
  
  SetAccum<Relationship> @@result;
  
  Start = {Concept.*};
  Related = SELECT t
           FROM Start:s-(RELATED_TO:e)->Concept:t
           WHERE s.name == conceptName
           ACCUM @@result += Relationship(s.name, t.name);
           
  RETURN @@result;
}
```

### Gremlin (Apache TinkerPop)
```groovy
g.V().hasLabel('Concept').has('name', 'Machine Learning')
 .out('RELATED_TO')
 .valueMap('name')
```

### SPARQL (for RDF graphs)
```sparql
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/ontology#>

SELECT ?relatedConcept
WHERE {
  ?concept ex:name "Machine Learning" .
  ?concept ex:relatedTo ?related .
  ?related ex:name ?relatedConcept .
}
```

## Common Graph Algorithms

### Pathfinding
- **Shortest Path**: Find the shortest route between two nodes
- **All Paths**: Find all possible routes between two nodes

### Centrality
- **Betweenness**: Measure of a node's importance as a connector
- **PageRank**: Relative importance based on incoming connections
- **Degree**: Number of connections a node has

### Community Detection
- **Label Propagation**: Fast community detection
- **Louvain Method**: Hierarchical clustering by modularity optimization

### Similarity
- **Jaccard Similarity**: Measure overlap between node neighborhoods
- **Cosine Similarity**: Compare vector representations of nodes

## Advantages for Knowledge Representation

1. **Natural data modeling**: Represents real-world entities and relationships naturally
2. **Relationship traversal**: Efficient for relationship-heavy queries
3. **Schema flexibility**: Can adapt to evolving data structures
4. **Performance for connected data**: Often outperforms relational databases for relationship queries

## Applications in Knowledge Management

### Knowledge Graphs
- Entity relationship mapping
- Semantic networks
- Ontology representation

### Recommendation Systems
- Content-based recommendations
- Collaborative filtering
- Hybrid approaches

### Natural Language Processing
- Entity recognition
- Relationship extraction
- Question answering

## Implementation in RAG Systems

Graph databases are particularly valuable in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for:

1. **Contextual retrieval**: Find documents connected to conversation history
2. **Knowledge organization**: Represent complex relationships between topics
3. **Conversation threading**: Track relationships between messages
4. **User interaction modeling**: Map user interests and behavior
5. **Multi-hop reasoning**: Follow chains of relationships between concepts

## Code Example: Building a Simple Knowledge Graph

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

class KnowledgeGraph:
    def __init__(self, uri, user, password):
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))
        
    def close(self):
        self.driver.close()
        
    def create_concept(self, name):
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            return session.write_transaction(
                self._create_concept_node, name)
                
    def link_concepts(self, name1, name2, relationship_type="RELATED_TO"):
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            return session.write_transaction(
                self._create_relationship, name1, name2, relationship_type)
                
    @staticmethod
    def _create_concept_node(tx, name):
        result = tx.run("CREATE (c:Concept {name: $name}) "
                        "RETURN id(c) AS node_id", name=name)
        return result.single()["node_id"]
        
    @staticmethod
    def _create_relationship(tx, name1, name2, rel_type):
        result = tx.run("MATCH (a:Concept {name: $name1}) "
                        "MATCH (b:Concept {name: $name2}) "
                        "CREATE (a)-[r:" + rel_type + "]->(b) "
                        "RETURN type(r) AS relationship", 
                        name1=name1, name2=name2)
        return result.single()["relationship"]
```
