    <h1>Understanding Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input.</p>
    
    <h2>Structure of a Neural Network</h2>
    <p>Neural networks consist of the following components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Input Layer</strong>: Receives the initial data.</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Layers</strong>: Where the computations happen. Most neural networks have one or more hidden layers.</li>
        <li><strong>Output Layer</strong>: Produces the final result.</li>
        <li><strong>Weights and Biases</strong>: Parameters that are adjusted during training to optimize performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Activation Functions</strong>: Such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh, which introduce non-linearity into the network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Neural Networks</h2>
    <h3>Feedforward Neural Networks</h3>
    <p>Information travels in one direction from input to output.</p>
    
    <h3>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h3>
    <p>Specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images.</p>
    
    <h3>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</h3>
    <p>Designed for sequential data, where context from previous inputs influences the processing of current input.</p>
    
    <h3>Transformers</h3>
    <p>A newer architecture that has revolutionized NLP and is now being applied to other domains as well.</p>

    <h2>Training a Neural Network</h2>
    <p>Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation, which involves:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Forward pass: Computing outputs given inputs.</li>
        <li>Computing the loss: Measuring how far the outputs are from the desired values.</li>
        <li>Backward pass: Calculating gradients of the loss with respect to the weights.</li>
        <li>Updating weights: Adjusting the weights to reduce the loss.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Advanced Concepts</h2>
    <p>More sophisticated neural network concepts include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transfer learning</li>
        <li>Generative adversarial networks (GANs)</li>
        <li>Attention mechanisms</li>
        <li>Graph neural networks</li>
    </ul>
