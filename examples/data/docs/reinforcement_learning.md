# Reinforcement Learning: An Overview

## Definition and Core Concepts

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm focused on how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, RL doesn't rely on labeled datasets but learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment.

### Key Components

- **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker
- **Environment**: The world with which the agent interacts
- **State**: A specific situation in which the agent finds itself
- **Action**: Choices the agent can make
- **Reward**: Feedback signal indicating the success of an action
- **Policy**: Strategy that the agent employs to decide actions
- **Value Function**: Prediction of future reward
- **Model**: Agent's representation of the environment

## The RL Process

1. The agent observes the current state of the environment
2. Based on this observation, the agent takes an action
3. The environment transitions to a new state
4. The environment provides a reward signal
5. The agent updates its knowledge based on the new state and reward
6. Process repeats until a terminal state or maximum steps are reached

## Mathematical Framework

RL problems are typically formalized using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which are defined by:

- Set of states S
- Set of actions A
- Transition probabilities P(s'|s,a)
- Reward function R(s,a,s')
- Discount factor γ ∈ [0,1]

The goal is to find a policy π(a|s) that maximizes expected cumulative discounted reward:

```
V^π(s) = E[Σ γ^t * R_t | S_0 = s, π]
```

## Major Algorithms

### Value-Based Methods

#### Q-Learning
Q-Learning learns the action-value function Q(s,a) directly:

```python
def q_learning(env, episodes=1000, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.99, epsilon=0.1):
    Q = defaultdict(lambda: np.zeros(env.action_space.n))
    
    for episode in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        
        while not done:
            # Epsilon-greedy action selection
            if random.random() < epsilon:
                action = env.action_space.sample()  # Explore
            else:
                action = np.argmax(Q[state])  # Exploit
            
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            
            # Q-learning update
            best_next_action = np.argmax(Q[next_state])
            td_target = reward + gamma * Q[next_state][best_next_action]
            td_error = td_target - Q[state][action]
            Q[state][action] += alpha * td_error
            
            state = next_state
    
    return Q
```

#### Deep Q-Network (DQN)
Extends Q-learning using deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function, enabling RL to work with high-dimensional state spaces.

### Policy-Based Methods

Policy-based methods learn the policy directly:

```python
def reinforce(env, policy_network, episodes=1000, lr=0.01, gamma=0.99):
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(policy_network.parameters(), lr=lr)
    
    for episode in range(episodes):
        states = []
        actions = []
        rewards = []
        state = env.reset()
        done = False
        
        while not done:
            # Forward pass through the policy network
            state_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(state).unsqueeze(0)
            action_probs = policy_network(state_tensor)
            
            # Sample action from the probability distribution
            m = Categorical(action_probs)
            action = m.sample()
            
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action.item())
            
            # Store state, action, reward
            states.append(state)
            actions.append(action)
            rewards.append(reward)
            
            state = next_state
        
        # Calculate returns
        returns = []
        G = 0
        for r in reversed(rewards):
            G = r + gamma * G
            returns.insert(0, G)
        returns = torch.tensor(returns)
        
        # Update policy
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss = 0
        for action, R, state in zip(actions, returns, states):
            state_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(state).unsqueeze(0)
            action_probs = policy_network(state_tensor)
            m = Categorical(action_probs)
            loss += -m.log_prob(action) * R
        
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    
    return policy_network
```
