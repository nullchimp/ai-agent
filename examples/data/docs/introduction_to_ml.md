# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Rather than following explicitly programmed instructions, these systems build models from sample data to make predictions or decisions.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning each training example is paired with an output value. The goal is to learn a mapping function from input variables to the output variable.

Common supervised learning algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data. Their goal is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data to learn more about it.

Common unsupervised learning algorithms include:
- Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering)
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., Principal Component Analysis, t-SNE)
- Association rules

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize some notion of reward.

## Applications
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

## Challenges
- Overfitting and underfitting
- Feature selection
- Handling missing data
- Interpretability and explainability
- Ethical considerations and bias
