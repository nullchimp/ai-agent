## Features

*   **Conversational AI:** Engage in natural language conversations.
*   **Tool Usage:** Utilize a variety of tools to perform actions like web searches, file operations, and more.
*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhance responses with information retrieved from a knowledge graph (Memgraph) and vector embeddings.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Integrate with external tools and services that adhere to the MCP standard.
*   **Modular Design:** Easily extendable with new tools, data sources, and functionalities.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Built with `asyncio` for efficient I/O-bound tasks.

## Architecture

The AI Agent's architecture is designed for modularity and scalability. Key components include:

*   **Agent Core (`src/agent.py`):** Orchestrates the conversation flow and tool interactions.
*   **LLM Services (`src/core/llm/`):** Manages communication with Large Language Models.
*   **RAG System (`src/core/rag/`):** Implements retrieval augmented generation using a graph database (Memgraph) and vector embeddings for contextual knowledge.
*   **MCP Integration (`src/core/mcp/`):** Handles discovery and communication with MCP-compatible tools.
*   **Libraries (`src/libs/`):** Reusable modules for data loading, file operations, etc.
*   **Tools (`src/tools/`):** A collection of callable tools that the agent can use.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nullchimp/ai-agent.git
    cd ai-agent
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required API keys and configurations (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `MEMGRAPH_HOST`).
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your credentials
    ```

5.  **Ensure Memgraph is running** (if using the RAG features with Memgraph).
    Refer to the [Memgraph documentation](https://memgraph.com/docs/getting-started) for setup instructions.

## Usage

The application can be run in two modes: CLI mode for direct interaction with the agent, and API mode which serves a web-based UI.

### CLI Mode

To run the agent in a command-line interface:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

### API & UI Mode

To run the backend server and the user interface:

1.  **Build the frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run ui:build
    ```

2.  **Run the API server:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py --api
    ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5555` and will also serve the frontend.

## User Interface

A ChatGPT-like frontend is included and served by the API server. It's built with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.

### Features

- ðŸŽ¨ Modern, clean ChatGPT-inspired interface
- ðŸ’¬ Real-time chat with typing indicators
- ðŸ“± Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- ðŸ’¾ Local chat history persistence
- ðŸ”„ Session management with multiple conversations
- âš¡ Fast and lightweight

### Building the Frontend

The frontend assets need to be built before running the API server.

```bash
npm run ui:build
```

This command compiles the TypeScript code and copies the necessary HTML and CSS files to the `src/ui/dist` directory, which is then served by the backend.

### Running the UI

To use the user interface, run the application in API mode:

```bash
python src/main.py --api
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5555` (or the configured host and port).

## Configuration

*   **Environment Variables (`.env`):** API keys, service endpoints (e.g., Memgraph host/port), and other sensitive configurations.
*   **MCP Configuration (`config/mcp.json`):** Defines connection details for external tools and services that follow the Model Context Protocol.

## Tools

The agent can be equipped with various tools to extend its capabilities. Current tools include:

*   `GoogleSearch`: Performs web searches using Google.
*   `ReadFile`: Reads content from files.
*   `WriteFile`: Writes content to files.
*   `ListFiles`: Lists files in a directory.
*   `GitHubKnowledgebase`: Searches for information on GitHub topics.

Tools are located in the `src/tools/` directory. New tools can be added by creating a new Python file in this directory and implementing the `Tool` interface (see `src/tools/__init__.py`).
