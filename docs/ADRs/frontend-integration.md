# ADR: Frontend Integration

**Status:** Proposed

**Date:** 2025-06-22

## Context

The AI agent currently lacks a user-friendly interface for interaction. The primary way to interact with the agent is through the command line or by running Python scripts, which is not ideal for non-technical users. To improve usability and provide a more intuitive experience, a graphical user interface (GUI) is required. The interface should be a chat-like application, similar to ChatGPT, allowing users to send messages to the agent and receive responses in real-time.

## Decision

We will build a single-page application (SPA) using Vue.js as the frontend framework. The application will be served by a simple web server and will communicate with the existing Python backend via its REST API.

The frontend will be responsible for:
- Rendering the chat interface.
- Managing the conversation state.
- Sending user messages to the backend API.
- Displaying the agent's responses.

Vue.js was chosen for its simplicity, performance, and ease of integration. We will use Vite as the build tool for a fast development experience.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Improved User Experience:** A dedicated chat interface will make the agent more accessible and easier to use.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The frontend and backend will be decoupled, allowing for independent development and deployment.
- **Modern Technology Stack:** Using Vue.js and Vite will provide a modern and efficient development environment.

### Negative
- **Increased Complexity:** Adding a frontend introduces another layer to the application stack, which increases the overall complexity.
- **Additional Dependencies:** The project will now have Node.js and npm as dependencies for frontend development.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** The backend will need to be configured to handle CORS requests from the frontend.

## Alternatives Considered

- **React:** While a powerful and popular choice, React can have a steeper learning curve than Vue.js. Given the simplicity of the required interface, Vue.js is a more pragmatic choice.
- **Angular:** Angular is a more opinionated and heavier framework, which is overkill for this project's needs.
- **Server-Side Rendering (e.g., with Flask and Jinja2):** This would simplify the tech stack but would result in a less responsive user experience compared to a SPA.

## Future Considerations

- **Real-time Communication:** We may consider using WebSockets for real-time communication between the frontend and backend to further improve the user experience.
- **Component Library:** As the application grows, we may introduce a component library like Vuetify or Quasar for a more consistent look and feel.
- **Authentication:** If user accounts are introduced, we will need to implement authentication and authorization.
